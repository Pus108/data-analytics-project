# 🛍️ Customer Purchase Prediction Project

This project aims to **predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service** based on their features and past behavior, using data analytics and basic machine learning techniques.

 📌 Objective

To analyze customer data, uncover patterns, and build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a customer making a purchase. This helps businesses improve targeting, optimize campaigns, and enhance customer retention.

 🚀 Project Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Selection and Encoding
- Model Building (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest)
- Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
- Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib

 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes customer information such as:
- Age, Gender
- Annual Income
- Purchase History
- Browsing Time
- Product/Service Interest

> Dataset used: bank-full.csv

 📁 Folder Structure

 ✅ Results

- Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** using [model name]
- Identified key influencing features for customer purchases
- Visualized customer segments with high conversion likelihood

## 📚 Learnings

- Importance of data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling imbalanced data
- Evaluating ML models effectively
- Extracting actionable insights from visualizations


 🤝 Acknowledgements
